I notice that the **Security Question (scope for this run)** section appears to be incomplete or missing from your prompt. The section starts with:

"**Security Question (scope for this run):** [File:"

But then cuts off without providing the actual security question I should investigate.

Without a specific security question to analyze, I cannot perform the targeted security audit as requested. The audit framework you've provided requires me to:

1. Focus investigation on a specific security question
2. Find vulnerabilities **related to that question**
3. Validate findings against that specific scope

**I need you to provide the complete security question** so I can conduct a proper security analysis of the 1inch Solana Fusion Protocol codebase.

Please re-send your query with the full security question clearly stated, and I'll perform a thorough investigation following the audit framework you've outlined.

**Note**: I cannot conduct a general "find any vulnerability" audit, as the instructions specifically require focusing on a single, well-defined security question. This targeted approach ensures the analysis is thorough and produces actionable findings rather than speculative issues.
